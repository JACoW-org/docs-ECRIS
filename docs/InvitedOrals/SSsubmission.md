# Submission of proposals for invited oral presentations by the SAB/OC/SPC

---

*This is an explanation for the Scientific Secretariat/Admin about what the SAB/OC/SPC will see and do during the **first step of the [workflow for the Submission of Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations](intro.md#normal-ipac-workflow)**.*

---

Once abstract submission (or proposals for invited orals in this case) is configured as explained above, the persons entered as "Authorized submitters" will see a link to Submit an Abstract from the Event Home Page (display view):

The Abstract Submission Form therefore appears as defined under Workflows / Call for Abstracts / Submission / Settings, described above.

At the top of the Abstract Submission page is a link to read the "submission instructions". It is the text entered in the "Instructions" text box in Submission / Settings. 

The following fields are available:

- **Title**: for the title of the submission

- **Content**: for a description of the work

- **Contribution type**: as described previously, only Invited Oral Presentation should be visible

- **Authors**: It is possible to search for authors (from the JACoW Central Repository) or to enter manually, and then configure the roles:

  Clear instructions on how to enter proposals for speakers are necessary to help the proposers with this job. Note for ECRIS SPC/SS: ECRIS OC/SPC/SAB members **should not normally propose themselves** for oral presentations

- **Comments**: This field is included in the default setup and can be note for any notes from the proposers

- **Track**: This is a required field (as setup in the settings).

- **Footnotes** ([if added as additional field](SSsetup.md#fields-and-types-contribution-types-abstract-fields)): The Footnotes field for JACoW events normally contain references to other work. How to enter Footnotes needs to be described carefully in the Instructions.
