# Abstract Initial QA of proposals

Prior to handing over all proposals to the SPC to decide contributed oral presentations, the Scientific Secretariat/Editor-in-Chief/Admin quality assures all proposals. In JACoW jargon this is known as Abstract Initial QA.

This job should be performed on all initial submission, which means between steps 1 and 2 of the [ECRIS workflow](intro.md#normal-ipac-workflow). It *could* be done, however, in parallel with steps 2 ~ 5 in case of little time available.

The procedure of Abstract Initial QA for contributed abstracts is identical to that of [Proposals for Invited Oral Contributions](../InvitedOrals/SSinitialQA.md). Please refer to those instructions for all the details.
