# How to login to the ECRIS Indico event

## Getting to the Indico event

The address of the ECRIS event you want to access is surely published on the website of the conference, often an istitute specific web page or Indico instance (e.g. for ECRIS'24 - Event Homepage <https://indico.gsi.de/event/17948> )

The usual URL for ECRIS JACoW Indico events is <https://indico.jacow.org/e/ECRISXXXX> (e.g., ECRIS'24 - Proceeding Management <https://indico.jacow.org/e/ECRIS2024> etc.)

ECRIS'24 actually was using two Indico instances, which can be quite confusing for your participants. If you have something similar try to make them distinguishable by titel and visually

* `indico.gsi.de` for the conference hompage, registration, event information, was called *Event Homepage*
* `indico.jacow.org`for the management of the scientific program, abstract, paper submission and editing, was called *JACoW Proceedings Management*

## Your JACoW account

All JACoW conference are organised around the [JACoW Central Repository](https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/jacow/profile.html) which is an enormous database of **_profiles_** (personal data including name, email and affiliation) and **_accounts_** (profiles with a username and password which allow login). Profiles are usually created by authors while submitting an abstract and adding co-authors not yet present in the Central Repository. Accounts can be created by any individual.

## Login

**To login to this special JACoW Indico installation, please be sure to use your JACoW account from the [JACoW Central Repository](https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/jacow/profile.html), which usually is _not_ your email address.**

## Troubleshooting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**If you cannot login to the ECRIS Indico event**, please try logging in the [JACoW Central Repository](https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/jacow/profile.html) first. If this works successfully, try logging in Indico with the same username/password. In case this won't work, contact the _Scientific Secretariat/Event Administrator_ (contacts are usually provided in the ECRIS event pages) or the _JACoW Repository Manager_ (exact contacts available at [JACoW / Contacts](https://www.jacow.org/Main/Contacts).
