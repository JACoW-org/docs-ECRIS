Professional electronic publication is not trivial, it cannot be improvised, and to publish according to JACoW's high standards implies that Team members receive adequate training, but also once their expertise is acquired, that they remain members of the Team for a certain period in order to take part in the training of novice editors.</p> <p>Since JACoW is based on good will, attendance at Team Meetings and participation in JACoW activities is essential to maintain high standards and continuity and to the success of the entire venture.
